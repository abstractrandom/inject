## Your Task

Implement the methods in `lib/inject.rb` marked `TODO` using `inject`.

Some methods are implemented already, but not using `inject`. First, rewrite
those methods to use `inject`, while keeping the tests in `spec/inject_spec.rb`
passing.

Next, delete the `pending` lines in `spec/inject_spec.rb` one-by-one and make
them pass by implementing the corresponding methods using `inject`.
